# IIR Filter in C
This repository contains an implementation of an Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter in C. The filter is designed to remove noise from a signal by using feedback to filter out specific frequency components.

## Getting Started
To use the filter, you will need to create the filter using the filter structure. It gets the parameters for a fourth order filter.

## Examples
./iir <audio_input.au >audio_output.au

## Limitations
The current implementation of the IIR filter is limited to fourth order filters. However, this can be easily extended to support higher order filters by modifying the iir.c file.
